# Readable git history #

## Always work on branch ##

Always create separate branch for ticket, issue, task etc. Don't commit anything on branch that's not directly part of that work.

When ready to merge *don't fast-forward; always create commit* to keep the branch history.


## Rebase before merge ##

Always rebase branch onto master before merging it in.
